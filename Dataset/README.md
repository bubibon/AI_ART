# Dataset

The dataset used for this thesis  consists of 5000 impressionistic landscape paintings and it was retrieved on Kaggle : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robgonsalves/impressionistlandscapespaintings .

Before using the latter, I experimented with some other dataset I personally built.
- Ukiyo-E style 1024x1024 paintings: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carlottabonanni/ukiyoe-1024x1024
- Abstract art paintings scraped from wikiart:
